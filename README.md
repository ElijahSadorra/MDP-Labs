# MDP Labs

A repo to store MDP Lab to ensure seamless development between home pc, laptop and lab pc.

### Lab 02:


Part 1: Sending data between multiple activities

- This is done by creating a dice-roller from activity one, sending data to activity two. Activity two is then rolling a random number and uses "finish()" and returns the data created to the first activity.

Part 2: Recycler view

- Overwriting recycler view to show different images in a scrollable fashion
